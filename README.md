# SousChef
SousChef is a voice controlled cooking assistant that runs in your browser.


How many times have you wanted to cook but you don't know how?
SousChef allows you to search for recipes across multiple websites.

But following a recipe can be tricky if your hands are messy.
You have to turn a page, scroll down, or click something to continue.
You also need to convert all of the units given manually if you have to!

SousChef provides a voice assistant named Sue to help you with all of this.
Sue will read you steps, convert units, and set timers for you. All you have to do is ask.
